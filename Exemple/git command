echo "# starter" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md

-------Update the code in your local repo with the changes from other members of your team using the following commands:

fetch , which downloads the changes from your remote repo but does not apply them to your code.
merge , which applies changes taken from fetch to a branch on your local repo.
pull , which is a combined command that does a fetch and then a merge.

> git pull

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
